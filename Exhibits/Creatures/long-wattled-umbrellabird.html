            This rare bird is considered rare and resides in humid to wet forests.
            They are often found on the Pacific slopes of southwest Colombia and western Ecuador, but occasionally can be found at lower altitudes.
            The males of this species are distinguished by their large throat wattle of feathers, while females and juveniles have no or a significantly smaller wattle.
            For those with it, they can even control the wattle, an example of which would be their ability to retract it during flight.
