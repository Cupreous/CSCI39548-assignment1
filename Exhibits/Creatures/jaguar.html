            This large cat species is the only living member of the Panthera genus that is native to the Americas.
            As the third largest cat species in the world, it has a body length of up to 1.85 meters and a weight of up to 158 kilograms.
            Their distinctive marked coat features tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides.
            This creature's powerful bite allows it to peirce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, in addition to being able to employ an unusual killing method:
            jaguars bite directly through the skull of mammalian prey.
