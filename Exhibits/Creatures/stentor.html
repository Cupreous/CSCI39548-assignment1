            Stentor is a very unique microscopic creature: it's one of the biggest protozoans that happens to be shaped
            like a trumpet.
            These organisms can regenerate if they get cut in half, making them very resilient. They also can attach
            each other to plants or other surfaces using their long tail, known as their contractile stalk.
            That ability is coupled with their other ability to stretch themselves up to 10 times their resting body
            length, giving them a range of mobility.
            These creatures can be often be found in freshwater environments, often attached to the underside of water
            plants.
