            This large bear is native to the Arctic and surrounding areas.
            Its the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing between 300 and 800 kilograms.
            Polar bears are unique insofar as that they're both terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living), while also being considered marine animals due to their dependence on marine ecosystems.
            Unfortunately, climate change has caused a decline in sea ice, giving the polar bear less access to its favoured prey and increasing the risk of malnutrition and starvation.
