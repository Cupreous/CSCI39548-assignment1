            Tardigrades, also known as water bears, can mostly commonly be found in moss, lichens, and leaf litter.
            They're extremely resilient, being able to survive in extreme conditions that would kill most other living
            creatures.
            They can survive temperatures as low as -458 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 302 degrees Fahrenheit. They
            can also survive for decades without food.
            Tardigrades are perhaps most known for their ability to survive in the vacuum of space, and the suspended
            animation state (cryptobiosis) that they can enter when in unfavorable conditions.
            They can last decades in that state, without water or oxygen, and then 'return to life' once their
            environment improves.
