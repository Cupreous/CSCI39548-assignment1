            This nocturnal bird is named for its large flattened hooked bill and huge frog-like gape, which they use to capture insects.
            This species and its family (the Podargidae), are restricted to Australia and New Guinea. They're known to take large prey, like small vertebrates.
            This bird and its family all have a limited ability to fly, typically resting horizontally on branches during the day (camouflaged by their cryptic plumage).
            The night is when this creature will come out to play, as you may be able to tell by their resemblance to owls.
