            Diatoms are single-celled algae that live in freshwater and saltwater.
            These microscopic organisms are essential for the health of our ecosystems:
            they are responsible for producing up to 40% of the oxygen we breath!
            They're also important food sources for other organisms in aquatic ecosystems, forming the base of the food
            chain for many aquatic animals.
            Their most notable feature is their cell walls, which are made of silica and have intricate designs that are
            unique to each species.
