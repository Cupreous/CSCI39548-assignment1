            Amoebas are microscopic creatures that can be found all around us!
            They are single-celled organisms that can be a variety of shapes and sizes.
            These organisms move and eat using pseudopods, which are like little arms that can extended and retract to
            help them 'grab' food;
            this makes them seem like they are constantly changing shape.
            Amoebas are very important for the ecosystem, since they are decomposers, which means that they are
            necessary for breaking down dead plants and animals and recycling their nutrients back into the environment.
