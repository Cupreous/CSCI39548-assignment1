            The Psychrolutidae fish family (a/k/a blobfishes) consists of bottom-dwelling marine sculpins shaped like tadpoles, with large heads and bodies that taper back into small, flat tails.
            Their skin is loosely attached and movable, with the layer underneath being gelatinous. 
            These fish live in highly pressurized depths, so they're an opportunistic predators that do not expend energy unless they're forced to in order to conserve it.
            That intense biological pressure to conserve energy within deep sea fish results in them being long lived, with slow rates of reproduction, growth, and aging; blobfishes can live up to 130 years!
