            The Arctic fox, also known as the snow fox, is a small fox that is native to the Arctic regions and is common throughout the Arctic tundra biome.
            This animal is well adapted to living in cold environments; it's well known for its thick, warm fur (that also serves as camouflage in the snow).
            They prey on many small creatures, such as lemmings and voles, in addition to eating carrion, seaweed, and insects.
            During breeding season, they will form monogamous pairs and stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens.
