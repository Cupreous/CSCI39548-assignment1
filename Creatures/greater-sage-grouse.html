            The greater sage-grouse, also known as the sagehen, is the largest grouse in North America.
            This bird is a permanent resident in its breeding grounds, but may move short distances to get to lower elevations during the winter.
            The species is unfortunately in decline across its range due to habitat loss, and thus has been recognized as threatened or near threatened by many national and international organizations.
            This species is known for its elaborate courtship rituals: each spring, males congregate in "leks" and perform a "strutting display." 
            Groups of females will observe these displays and select the most attractive males with which to mate.
