            These carnivorous mammals are either semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine (depending on exact species), and they all have diets based on fish and invertebrates.
            Otters' most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet they use to swim and their ability to hold their breath underwater for extreme periods of time.
            They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by a layer of long guard hairs; this traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and slightly buoyant under water.
            Otters are playful animals, and appear to engage in many behaviors solely for enjoyment: this includes making waterslides and using them to enter the water. They also sometimes find and play with small stones.
