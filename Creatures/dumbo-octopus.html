            This genus of pelagic cirrate (finned) octopods is known as the dumbo octopuses.
            The name "dumbo" refers to their resemblance to the title character of Disney's 1941 film, Dumbo;
            they both have a prominent ear-like fin which extends from the mantle above each eye.
            Species of this octopus live at depths of 1,000 meters and below, and so they don't have that many predators.
            In fact, they have only ever been recorded in the stomach contents of a shark. 
            Unlike other octopuses, they have no ink sac and are incapable of changing color, so how these octopuses escape or evade predators is unknown.
