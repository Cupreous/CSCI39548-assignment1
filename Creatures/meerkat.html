            The meerkat is a small mongoose found in southern Africa. 
            Their foreclaws have adapted for digging and they have also developed the ability to thermoregulate, allowing them to survive in their harsh and dry habitat.
            These highly social creatures form packs ranging from two to thirty individuals that occupy homes that can spread up to five kilometers in area. 
            Their packs will develop a social hierarchy, with generally dominant individuals breeding and producing offspring, with the subordinate members providing altruistic care to the pups.
