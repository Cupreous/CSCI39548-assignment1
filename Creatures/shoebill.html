            The shoebill, also known as the whalebill, is a large long-legged wading bird.
            It's name, as you might be able to guess, is derived from its enormous shoe-shaped bill.
            This bird, which is genetically close to the pelican, has a gliding distance between the larger storks and the condor.
            Although this is impressive amongst its relatives, only a few flights beyond its minimum forging distance (20m) have ever been recorded.
            Found in the freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa, this non-migratory bird will only change location if its food supply runs out or its disturbed by humans.
