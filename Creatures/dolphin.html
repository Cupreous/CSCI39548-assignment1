            This aquatic mammal is known to be very intelligent; dolphins have shown that they're able to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve.
            They're also highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals (although this varies with species and location).
            In places with a high abundance of food, they're even known to form "superpods" of over 1000 dolphins. They can communicate with each other using a variety of clicks, whist-like sounds and other vocalizations.
            They're even known to use nonverbal communication by means of touch and posturing. 
            Dolphins also display culture: some species teach their young to use tools and they exhibit other learned behaviors like using sponges to protect their mouths.
